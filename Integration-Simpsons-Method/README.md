# Integration by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
--- 
## Simpson(x, y) - Numerically evaluates the integral of a data set using Simpson's 1/3 Rule

## Inputs:
* x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y = the vector of function values with respect to x

## Outputs:
* I = the numerical integral calculated 
---
## EX:
x = [1 2 3 4 5];

y = [15 17 29 30 27];

I = Simpson(x,y);
