# MECH-105-Algorithms
---
  This is a collection of MATLAB algorithms written for my MECH-105 class. This is an intro level numerical methods class so the algorithms included are meant to solve problems relating to root finding, systems of equations and other relative problems. Desctiptions of each function are included in their respective folders as well as within each algorithm.
